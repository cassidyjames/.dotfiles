# bash-aliases
Handy aliases I use in bash.

If you don't have your own `.bash_aliases` file and just want to use mine, you can symlink it (that way you can always `git pull` for updated versions`). For example:

```shell
ln -s ~/Projects/cassidyjames/bash-aliases/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bash_aliases
```
